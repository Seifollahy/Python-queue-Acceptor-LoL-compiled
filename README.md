I was inspired by the lucassmonn code
[accept-queue-lol-telegram](https://github.com/lucassmonn/accept-queue-lol-telegram), and I modify it according to my needs. That I have compiled in order to make it accessible to everyone.

For Windows only, check [python version](https://github.com/reusteur73/LoL_auto_queue_acceptor) (But you would need to install all the right packages in the right versions.)

## How to use

    1 - Download this respo as zip.  
    2 - Unzip  
    3 - Execute match_accept.exe in the folder  
    4 - Queue up and have fun :D
